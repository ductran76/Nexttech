                    <p>
                        Hanoi, April 15th 2016, according to 2015 e-Commerce report announced today by Vietnam e-Commerce 

                        and Information Technology Agency (www.vecita.gov.vn), the first e-marketplace in the

                        country since 2005 ChoDienTu.vn is ranked second largest e-Commerce website in sales revenue.

                        This fact has shown that local e-Commerce players having unique strategy and in-depth local

                        understanding can counter foreign giants, given much smaller funding.

                        This news has marked the spectacular rerising of the earliest e-Marketplace in Vietnam since 2005

                        and has been quite silent in recent few years. <br/><br/>To summarize on this achievement, Mr. Nguyen Hoa

                        Binh, chairman for PeaceSoft-group owning ChoDienTu.vn said: “Facing the e-Commerce fever in

                        the last few years whereas many deep pocketed players have been giving discount and promotion

                        to buy growth, but then shutdown losing dozens millions USD investment because of inefficiency;

                        ChoDienTu.vn has chosen in-depth strategy by silently investing infrastructure service to create

                        long term values and improve quality of service for buyers and sellers”.

                        Specifically, starting from just a single e-Marketplace 11 years ago, in the last 6 years PeaceSoft-

                        group has grown into a multi-services ecosystem including NganLuong.vn online payment platform,

                        eBay.vn cross border buying platform, ShipChung.vn shipping and cash-on-delivery platform,

                        strategic partnership with the first warehousing and fulfilment platform BoxMe.vn… making

                        customers to prioritize one-stop e-Commerce service on ChoDienTu.vn for their online buying and

                        selling needs.<br/> <br/>“With this our so-called “people’s war” strategy, if Jack Ma is the crocodile in the

                        Yangtze River then we will be a school of piranhas ready to fairly compete with Alibaba in Vietnam”,

                        Mr.Binh confidently responded to interview question on the upcoming thread from Chinese e-Commerce 

                        giant after their Lazada acquisition.

                        ChoDienTu.vn is owned by PeaceTech joint stock company, a subsidiary of PeaceSoft-group joint

                        venture with eBay and majority controlled by Vietnamese veteran technopreneurs. “For the last 11

                        years total funding amount into ChoDienTu.vn was 50% less than the recently shutdown Deca.vn

                        has spent for 2 years and 50 times less than currently number one e-Commerce website has spent

                        for the last 4 years, that means e-Commerce does not absolutely require much money like someone

                        has said while IDG’s project Lana was shutdown but firstly a team of people with in-depth local

                        understanding”, Mr.Binh concluded./.
